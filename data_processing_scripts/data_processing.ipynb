      "of a substance or another medical or neurological condition.\n",
      "Diagnostic Features\n",
      "The core feature of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is chronic\n",
      "severe, persistent irritability. This severe irritability has two prominent\n",
      "clinical manifestations, the first of which is frequent temper outbursts.\n",
      "These outbursts typically occur in response to frustration and can be verbal\n",
      "or behavioral (the latter in the form of aggression against property, self, or\n",
      "others). They must occur frequently (i.e., on average, three or more times\n",
      "per week) (Criterion C) over at least 1 year in at least two settings (Criteria\n",
      "E and F), such as in the home and at school, and they must be\n",
      "developmentally inappropriate (Criterion B). The second manifestation of\n",
      "severe irritability consists of chronic, persistently irritable or angry mood\n",
      "that is present between the severe temper outbursts. This irritable or angry\n",
      "mood must be characteristic of the child, being present most of the day,\n",
      "nearly every day, and noticeable by others in the child’s environment\n",
      "(Criterion D).\n",
      "The clinical presentation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n",
      "must be carefully distinguished from presentations of other, related\n",
      "conditions, particularly pediatric bipolar disorder. In fact, disruptive mood\n",
      "dysregulation disorder was added to DSM-5 to address the considerable\n",
      "concern about the appropriate classification and treatment of children who\n",
      "present with chronic, persistent irritability relative to children who present\n",
      "with classic (i.e., episodic) bipolar disorder.\n",
      "Some researchers view severe, nonepisodic irritability as characteristic\n",
      "of bipolar disorder in children, although both DSM-IV and DSM-5 require\n",
      "that both children and adults have distinct episodes of mania or hypomania\n",
      "to qualify for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. During the latter decades\n",
      "of the twentieth century, this contention by researchers that severe,\n",
      "nonepisodic irritability is a manifestation of pediatric mania coincided with\n",
      "an upsurge in the rates at which clinicians assigned the diagnosis of bipolar\n",
      "disorder to their pediatric patients. This sharp increase in rates appears to be\n",
      "attributable to clinicians combining at least two clinical presentations into a\n",
      "single category. That is, both classic, episodic presentations of mania and\n",
      "nonepisodic presentations of severe irritability have been labeled as bipolar\n",
      "disorder in children. In DSM-5, the term bipolar disorder is explicitly\n",
      "reserved for episodic presentations of bipolar symptoms. DSM-IV did not\n",
      "include a diagnosis designed to capture youths whose hallmark symptoms\n",
      "consisted of very severe, nonepisodic irritability, whereas DSM-5, with the\n",
      "inclusion of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, provides a distinct\n",
      "category for such presentations.\n",
      "Prevalence\n",
      "Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is common among children\n",
      "presenting to pediatric mental health clinics. Prevalence estimates of the\n",
      "disorder in the community are unclear. In a population-based cohort study\n",
      "of Brazilian 11-year-olds that used a specific module for disruptive mood\n",
      "dysregulation disorder, the prevalence was 2.5%.\n",
      "Consistent gender differences in prevalence have not been reported in\n",
      "population samples, although clinic samples report a male preponderance.\n",
      "For example, up to 80% of children presenting to clinics in Turkey with\n",
      "features of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder in a chart review were\n",
      "boys. Data suggest that the diagnosis may be more common in younger age\n",
      "groups (e.g., 8.2% in a community sample of 6-year-olds in the United\n",
      "States).\n",
      "Development and Course\n",
      "The onset of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be before age 10\n",
      "years, and the diagnosis should not be applied to children with a\n",
      "developmental age of younger than 6 years. It is unknown whether the\n",
      "condition presents only in this age-delimited fashion. Because the\n",
      "symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are likely to change as\n",
      "children mature, use of the diagnosis should be restricted to age groups\n",
      "similar to those in which validity has been established (6–18 years).\n",
      "Approximately half of children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n",
      "living in a predominantly rural area in a large U.S. study continue to have\n",
      "symptoms that meet criteria for the condition 1 year later, although those\n",
      "children whose symptoms no longer meet the threshold for the diagnosis\n",
      "often have persistent, clinically impairing irritability. Rates of conversion\n",
      "from severe, nonepisodic irritability to bipolar disorder are very low.\n",
      "Instead, children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are at\n",
      "increased risk to develop unipolar depressive and/or anxiety disorders in\n",
      "adulthood.\n",
      "Risk and Prognostic Factors\n",
      "Temperamental. Children with chronic irritability typically exhibit\n",
      "complicated psychiatric histories. In such children, a relatively extensive\n",
      "history of chronic irritability is common, typically manifesting before full\n",
      "criteria for the syndrome are met. Such prediagnostic presentations may\n",
      "have qualified for a diagnosis of oppositional defiant\n",
      "disorder. Many children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have\n",
      "symptoms that also meet criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\n",
      "(ADHD) and for an anxiety disorder, with such diagnoses often being\n",
      "present from a relatively early age. For some children, the criteria for major\n",
      "depressive disorder may also be met.\n",
      "Environmental. Factors associated with disrupted family life, such as\n",
      "psychological abuse or neglect, parental psychiatric disorder, limited\n",
      "parental education, single-parent household, early trauma, death of a parent,\n",
      "parental grief, divorce, and malnutrition (e.g., vitamin deficiency), are\n",
      "associated with the core behaviors of disruptive mood dysregulation\n",
      "disorder.\n",
      "Genetic and physiological. Data suggest that a family history of depression\n",
      "may be a risk factor for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Consistent\n",
      "with this, twin data suggest that the association between early irritability\n",
      "and later unipolar depression and anxiety may be, in part, genetically\n",
      "mediated.\n",
      "Compared with children with pediatric bipolar disorder or other mental\n",
      "illnesses, those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder exhibit both\n",
      "commonalities and differences in information-processing deficits. For\n",
      "example, face-emotion labeling deficits, as well as perturbed decision-\n",
      "making and cognitive control, are present in children with bipolar disorder\n",
      "as well as those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Importantly,\n",
      "however, the same behavioral deficit may be associated with different\n",
      "patterns of neural dysfunction. There is also evidence for disorder-specific\n",
      "dysfunction, such as during tasks assessing attention deployment in\n",
      "response to emotional stimuli, which has demonstrated unique signs of\n",
      "dysfunction in children with chronic irritability.\n",
      "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues\n",
      "Culture-related data on disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are limited.\n",
      "However, sociocultural factors affect the presentation of core psychological\n",
      "features of the disorder, including impulsivity as well as emotion, reward,\n",
      "threat, and behavior dysregulation, especially in settings characterized by\n",
      "severe social disruption, such as postconflict zones or communities affected\n",
      "by long-standing racism and discrimination. It is important to distinguish\n",
      "disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from adaptive responses to\n",
      "adversity that are context-dependent and transitory.\n",
      "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues\n",
      "There is some evidence from twin studies that while irritability has a strong\n",
      "genetic component in both sexes, patterns differ for boys and girls. For\n",
      "boys, genetic factors appear to account for an increasing amount of the\n",
      "variance of the phenotype of irritability throughout childhood. While\n",
      "genetic factors account for a large proportion of the variance of the\n",
      "irritability phenotype in school-age girls, this decreases into adolescence\n",
      "and young adulthood, with environmental influences playing a greater role.\n",
      "How this genetic risk for irritability translates into risk and prognosis for\n",
      "disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, per se, is not yet known.\n",
      "Functional Consequences of Disruptive Mood\n",
      "Dysregulation Disorder\n",
      "Chronic, severe irritability, such as is seen in disruptive mood dysregulation\n",
      "disorder, is associated with marked disruption in a child’s family and peer\n",
      "relationships, as well as in school performance. Because of their extremely\n",
      "low frustration tolerance, such children generally have difficulty succeeding\n",
      "in school; they are often unable to participate in the activities typically\n",
      "enjoyed by healthy children; their family life is severely disrupted by their\n",
      "outbursts and irritability; and they have trouble initiating or sustaining\n",
      "friendships. Levels of dysfunction in children with bipolar disorder and\n",
      "disruptive mood\n",
      "dysregulation disorder are generally comparable. Both conditions cause\n",
      "severe disruption in the lives of the affected individual and his or her\n",
      "family. In both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and pediatric bipolar\n",
      "disorder, aggression and psychiatric hospitalization are common.\n",
      "Differential Diagnosis\n",
      "Because chronically irritable children and adolescents typically present with\n",
      "complex histories, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n",
      "must be made while considering the presence or absence of multiple other\n",
      "conditions. Despite the need to consider many other syndromes,\n",
      "differentiation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from bipolar\n",
      "disorder and oppositional defiant disorder requires particularly careful\n",
      "assessment.\n",
      "Bipolar disorders. The central feature differentiating disruptive mood\n",
      "dysregulation disorder and bipolar disorders in children involves the\n",
      "longitudinal course of the core symptoms. In children, as in adults, bipolar I\n",
      "disorder and bipolar II disorder manifest as an episodic illness with discrete\n",
      "episodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from the child’s\n",
      "typical presentation. The mood perturbation that occurs during a manic\n",
      "episode is distinctly different from the child’s usual mood. In addition,\n",
      "during a manic episode, the change in mood must be accompanied by the\n",
      "onset, or worsening, of associated cognitive, behavioral, and physical\n",
      "symptoms (e.g., distractibility, increased goal-directed activity), which are\n",
      "also present to a degree that is distinctly different from the child’s usual\n",
      "baseline. Thus, in the case of a manic episode, parents (and, depending on\n",
      "developmental level, children) should be able to identify a distinct time\n",
      "period during which the child’s mood and behavior were markedly different\n",
      "from usual. In contrast, the irritability of disruptive mood dysregulation\n",
      "disorder is persistent and is present over many months; while it may wax\n",
      "and wane to a certain degree, severe irritability is characteristic of the child\n",
      "with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Thus, while bipolar disorders\n",
      "are episodic conditions, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is not. In\n",
      "fact, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot be\n",
      "assigned to a child who has ever experienced a full-duration hypomanic or\n",
      "manic episode (irritable or euphoric) or who has ever had a manic or\n",
      "hypomanic episode lasting more than 1 day. Another central differentiating\n",
      "feature between bipolar disorders and disruptive mood dysregulation\n",
      "disorder is the presence of elevated or expansive mood and grandiosity.\n",
      "These symptoms are common features of mania but are not characteristic of\n",
      "disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.\n",
      "Oppositional defiant disorder. While symptoms of oppositional defiant\n",
      "disorder typically do occur in children with disruptive mood dysregulation\n",
      "disorder, mood symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are\n",
      "relatively rare in children with oppositional defiant disorder. The key\n",
      "features that warrant the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation\n",
      "disorder in children whose symptoms also meet criteria for oppositional\n",
      "defiant disorder are the presence of severe and frequently recurrent\n",
      "outbursts and a persistent disruption in mood between outbursts. In\n",
      "addition, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder requires\n",
      "severe impairment in at least one setting (i.e., home, school, or among\n",
      "peers) and mild to moderate impairment in a second setting. For this reason,\n",
      "while most children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood\n",
      "dysregulation disorder will also have a presentation that meets criteria for\n",
      "oppositional defiant disorder, the reverse is not the case. That is, in only\n",
      "approximately 15% of individuals with oppositional defiant disorder would\n",
      "criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder be met. Moreover, even\n",
      "for children in whom criteria for both disorders are met, only the diagnosis\n",
      "of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. Finally, both the\n",
      "prominent mood symptoms in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and\n",
      "the high risk for depressive and anxiety disorders in follow-up studies\n",
      "justify placement of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder among the\n",
      "depressive disorders in DSM-5. (Oppositional defiant disorder is included\n",

      "have been modified to include only these nonvegetative symptoms appear\n",
      "to identify nearly the same individuals as do the full criteria.\n",
      "Associated Features\n",
      "Major depressive disorder is associated with high mortality, much of which\n",
      "is accounted for by suicide; however, it is not the only cause. For example,\n",
      "depressed individuals admitted to nursing homes have a markedly increased\n",
      "likelihood of death in the first year. Individuals frequently present with\n",
      "tearfulness, irritability, brooding, obsessive rumination, anxiety, phobias,\n",
      "excessive worry over physical health, and complaints of pain (e.g.,\n",
      "headaches; joint, abdominal, or other pains). In children, separation anxiety\n",
      "may occur.\n",
      "Although an extensive literature exists describing neuroanatomical,\n",
      "neuroendocrinological, and neurophysiological correlates of major\n",
      "depressive disorder, no laboratory test has yielded results of sufficient\n",
      "sensitivity and specificity to be used as a diagnostic tool for this disorder.\n",
      "Until recently, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity had been\n",
      "the most extensively investigated abnormality associated with major\n",
      "depressive episodes, and it appears to be associated with melancholia (a\n",
      "particularly severe type of depression), psychotic features, and risks for\n",
      "eventual suicide. Molecular studies have also implicated peripheral factors,\n",
      "including genetic variants in neurotrophic factors and pro-inflammatory\n",
      "cytokines. Additionally, volumetric and functional magnetic resonance\n",
      "imaging studies provide evidence for abnormalities in specific neural\n",
      "systems supporting emotion processing, reward seeking, and emotion\n",
      "regulation in adults with major depression.\n",
      "Prevalence\n",
      "Twelve-month prevalence of major depressive disorder in the United States\n",
      "is approximately 7%, with marked differences by age group such that the\n",
      "prevalence in 18- to 29-year-old\n",
      "individuals is threefold higher than the prevalence in individuals age 60\n",
      "years or older. The most reproducible finding in the epidemiology of major\n",
      "depressive disorder has been a higher prevalence in females, an effect that\n",
      "peaks in adolescence and then stabilizes. Women experience approximately\n",
      "twofold higher rates than men, especially between menarche and\n",
      "menopause. Women report more atypical symptoms of depression\n",
      "characterized by hypersomnia, increased appetite, and leaden paralysis\n",
      "compared with men.\n",
      "Systematic reviews show that the 12-month and point prevalence of\n",
      "major depressive disorder vary eight- to ninefold across global geographic\n",
      "regions. In the United States, prevalence increased from 2005 to 2015, with\n",
      "steeper rates of increase for youth compared with older groups. After\n",
      "stratification by ethnoracial groups, non-Hispanic Whites showed a\n",
      "significant increase in prevalence after adjustment for demographic\n",
      "characteristics, whereas no significant change in rate of depression was\n",
      "observed among non-Hispanic Blacks or Hispanics.\n",
      "Development and Course\n",
      "Major depressive disorder may first appear at any age, but the likelihood of\n",
      "onset increases markedly with puberty. In the United States, incidence\n",
      "appears to peak in the 20s; however, first onset in late life is not uncommon.\n",
      "The course of major depressive disorder is quite variable, such that\n",
      "some individuals rarely, if ever, experience remission (a period of 2 or more\n",
      "months with no symptoms, or only one or two symptoms to no more than a\n",
      "mild degree), while others experience many years with few or no symptoms\n",
      "between discrete episodes. The course of depression may reflect social-\n",
      "structural adversity associated with poverty, racism, and marginalization.\n",
      "It is important to distinguish individuals who present for treatment\n",
      "during an exacerbation of a chronic depressive illness from those whose\n",
      "symptoms developed recently. Chronicity of depressive symptoms\n",
      "substantially increases the likelihood of underlying personality, anxiety, and\n",
      "substance use disorders and decreases the likelihood that treatment will be\n",
      "followed by full symptom resolution. It is therefore useful to ask\n",
      "individuals presenting with depressive symptoms to identify the last period\n",
      "of at least 2 months during which they were entirely free of depressive\n",
      "symptoms. Cases in which depressive symptoms are present for more days\n",
      "than not might warrant an additional diagnosis of persistent depressive\n",
      "disorder.\n",
      "Recovery from a major depressive episode begins within 3 months of\n",
      "onset for 40% of individuals with major depression and within 1 year for\n",
      "80% of individuals. Recency of onset is a strong determinant of the\n",
      "likelihood of near-term recovery, and many individuals who have been\n",
      "depressed for only several months can be expected to recover\n",
      "spontaneously. Features associated with lower recovery rates, other than\n",
      "current episode duration, include psychotic features, prominent anxiety,\n",
      "personality disorders, and symptom severity.\n",
      "The risk of recurrence becomes progressively lower over time as the\n",
      "duration of remission increases. The risk is higher in individuals whose\n",
      "preceding episode was severe, in younger individuals, and in individuals\n",
      "who have already experienced multiple episodes. The persistence of even\n",
      "mild depressive symptoms during remission is a powerful predictor of\n",
      "recurrence.\n",
      "Many bipolar illnesses begin with one or more depressive episodes, and\n",
      "a substantial proportion of individuals who initially appear to have major\n",
      "depressive disorder will prove, in time, to instead have a bipolar disorder.\n",
      "This is more likely in individuals with onset of the illness in adolescence,\n",
      "those with psychotic features, and those with a family history of bipolar\n",
      "illness. The presence of a “with mixed features” specifier also increases the\n",
      "risk for future manic or hypomanic diagnosis. Major depressive disorder,\n",
      "particularly with psychotic features, may also transition into schizophrenia,\n",
      "a change that is much more frequent than the reverse.\n",
      "There are no clear effects of current age on the course or treatment\n",
      "response of major depressive disorder. Some symptom differences exist,\n",
      "though, such that hypersomnia and hyperphagia are more likely in younger\n",
      "individuals, and melancholic symptoms, particularly psychomotor\n",
      "disturbances, are more common in older individuals. Depressions with\n",
      "earlier ages at onset are more familial and more likely to involve\n",
      "personality disturbances. The course of major depressive disorder within\n",
      "individuals does not generally change with aging. Mean times to recovery\n",
      "do not change over multiple episodes, and the likelihood of being in an\n",
      "episode does not generally increase or decrease with time.\n",
      "Risk and Prognostic Factors\n",
      "Temperamental. Negative affectivity (neuroticism) is a well-established risk\n",
      "factor for the onset of major depressive disorder, and high levels appear to\n",
      "render individuals more likely to develop depressive episodes in response to\n",
      "stressful life events.\n",
      "Environmental. Adverse childhood experiences, particularly when they are\n",
      "multiple and of diverse types, constitute a set of potent risk factors for\n",
      "major depressive disorder. Women may be disproportionately at risk for\n",
      "adverse childhood experiences, including sexual abuse, that may contribute\n",
      "to the increased prevalence of depression in this group. Other social\n",
      "determinants of mental health, such as low income, limited formal\n",
      "education, racism, and other forms of discrimination, are associated with\n",
      "higher risk of major depressive disorder. Stressful life events are well\n",
      "recognized as precipitants of major depressive episodes, but the presence or\n",
      "absence of adverse life events near the onset of episodes does not appear to\n",
      "provide a useful guide to prognosis or treatment selection. Etiologically,\n",
      "women are disproportionately affected by major risk factors for depression\n",
      "across the life span, including interpersonal trauma.\n",
      "Genetic and physiological. First-degree family members of individuals with\n",
      "major depressive disorder have a risk for major depressive disorder two- to\n",
      "fourfold higher than that of the general population. Relative risks appear to\n",
      "be higher for early-onset and recurrent forms. Heritability is approximately\n",
      "40%, and the personality trait neuroticism accounts for a substantial portion\n",
      "of this genetic liability.\n",
      "Women may also be at risk for depressive disorders in relation to\n",
      "specific reproductive life stages, including in the premenstrual period,\n",
      "postpartum, and in perimenopause.\n",
      "Course modifiers. Essentially all major nonmood disorders (i.e., anxiety,\n",
      "substance use, trauma- and stressor-related, feeding and eating, and\n",
      "obsessive-compulsive and related disorders) increase the risk of an\n",
      "individual developing depression. Major depressive episodes that develop\n",

      "may obscure and delay their recognition. However, sustained clinical\n",
      "improvement in depressive symptoms may depend on the appropriate\n",
      "treatment of underlying illnesses. Chronic or disabling medical conditions\n",
      "also increase risks for major depressive episodes. Prevalent illnesses such as\n",

      "Symptoms commonly associated with depression across cultural contexts,\n",
      "not listed in the DSM criteria, include social isolation or loneliness, anger,\n",
      "crying, and diffuse pain. A wide range of other somatic complaints are\n",

      "of schizophrenia spectrum disorders in some ethnic and racialized groups\n",
      "facing discrimination. Cross-nationally, higher levels of income inequality\n",
      "in a society are associated with higher prevalence of major depressive\n",
      "disorder. In the United States, the chronicity of major depressive disorder\n",
      "appears to be higher among African Americans and Caribbean Blacks\n",
      "compared with non-Latinx Whites, possibly because of the impact of\n",

      "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues\n",
      "There are no clear differences between genders in treatment response or\n",

      "abuse, a medication, or a toxin exposure) (Criterion B). In order to meet\n",
      "criteria for the diagnosis, the depressive symptoms must have developed\n",
      "during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure\n",
      "to or withdrawal from a medication, as evidenced by clinical history,\n",
      "physical examination, or laboratory findings (Criterion B1), and the\n",

      "better explained by a non-substance/medication-induced depressive\n",

      "substance/medication use, the depressive symptoms persist beyond a\n",
      "substantial period of time after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe\n",
      "intoxication, or there is other evidence that suggests the existence of an\n",
      "independent non-substance/medication-induced depressive disorder\n",
      "(Criterion C), such as a history of recurrent non-substance-induced\n",
      "depressive episodes. This diagnosis should not be made when symptoms\n",
      "occur exclusively during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). Finally, the\n",
      "diagnosis requires that the substance/medication-induced depressive\n",
      "symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,\n",
      "occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion E). The\n",
      "substance-induced depressive disorder diagnosis should be made instead of\n",
      "a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when\n",
      "the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and are\n",
      "sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.\n",
      "The two categories of drugs of abuse most likely to cause a\n",

      "intoxication with alcohol, benzodiazepines and other sedative, hypnotic, or\n",
      "anxiolytic drugs) and stimulants (e.g., withdrawal from amphetamine-type\n",

      "medications such as clonidine, guanethidine, methyldopoa, and reserpine;\n",
      "interferon; L-dopa) are especially likely to cause substance/medication-\n",

      "history of major depressive disorder would qualify for the diagnosis of a\n",

      "previously established condition (e.g., major depressive disorder, recurrent)\n",
      "can recur while the individual is\n",

      "A substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is distinguished\n",

      "depressive symptoms after exposure to, withdrawal from, or intoxication\n",
      "with that substance prior to the onset of the depressive disorder. The\n",
      "neurochemical changes associated with intoxication and withdrawal states\n",
      "for some substances can be relatively protracted, and thus intense\n",

      "population, the lifetime prevalence of substance/medication-induced\n",
      "depressive disorder in the absence of a lifetime history of non-substance-\n",
      "induced depressive disorder was only 0.26%. These data indicate that\n",
      "special care must be taken to search for and address substance-induced\n",
      "conditions in individuals with alcohol and stimulant use disorders.\n",
      "Development and Course\n",
      "A depressive disorder associated with the use of substances (e.g., alcohol,\n",
      "amphetamine-type substances and/or cocaine, or a prescribed treatment for\n",
      "medical conditions) must have its onset while the individual is using the\n",
      "substance or during withdrawal, if there is a withdrawal syndrome\n",
      "associated with the substance. Most often, the depressive disorder has its\n",
      "onset within the first few weeks or 1 month of heavy use of the substance.\n",
      "Once the substance is discontinued, the depressive symptoms usually remit\n",
      "within days to several weeks, depending on the half-life of the\n",
      "substance/medication and the presence of a withdrawal syndrome. If\n",
      "symptoms persist 4 weeks beyond the expected time course of withdrawal\n",
      "of a particular substance/medication, other causes for the depressive mood\n",

      "treatment, or participants in large cross-sectional studies. More studies exist\n",
      "regarding the clinical course of alcohol- and illicit drug–induced\n",
      "depressions, and most support the contention that the substance-induced\n",
      "conditions are very likely to fade away within a relatively short time after\n",
      "abstinence. Equally important are indications that individuals with\n",
      "significant residual depressive symptoms following treatment for substance\n",

      "Risk and Prognostic Factors\n",

      "antisocial personality disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder; a\n",
      "history of stressful life events in the past 12 months; a history of prior drug-\n",
      "induced depressions; and a family history of substance use disorders. In\n",
      "addition, neurochemical changes associated with alcohol and other drugs of\n",
      "abuse often contribute to depressive and anxiety symptoms during\n",
      "withdrawal that subsequently influence ongoing substance use and reduce\n",
